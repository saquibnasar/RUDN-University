                        <h3>Peer Review Process</h3>
                        <p></p>
                        <p>The editorial board has the right to reject texts at the stage of pre-review;
                             articles rejected by the editors at the pre-review stage are not subject to further consideration, 
                            the editors do not provide expert opinions on them to the author.
                        </p>
                        <p>A double-blind peer review method is mandatory for the processing of all scientific
                             manuscripts submitted to the 
                            editorial staff of the journal and not rejected at the stage of pre-reviewing. This
                             implies that neither the reviewer is aware of the authorship of the manuscript, nor the author
                              maintains any contact with the reviewer.
                            </p>
                              <ol style="padding-left: 25px;">
                                  <li>Members of the editorial board and leading global experts in corresponding areas of sciences
                                       invited as independent readers, perform peer reviews. Editor-in-chief, deputy editor-in-chief
                                        or science editor choose readers for peer review. We aim to limit the review process to 2-4 weeks,
                                       though in some cases the schedule may be adjusted at the reviewer’s request.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Reviewer has an option to abnegate the assessment should any conflict of interests arise that may affect
                                         perception or interpretation of the manuscript. Upon the scrutiny,
                                         the reviewer is expected to present the editorial board with one of the following recommendations:</li>
                                         <ul class="titleauthors" style="padding-left: 25px;" >
                                             <li>to accept the paper in its present state;</li>
                                             <li>to invite the author to revise their manuscript and address specific concerns before a final decision is reached;</li>
                                             <li>that final decision be reached following further reviewing by another specialist;</li>
                                             <li>to reject the manuscript outright.</li>
                                         </ul>
                                         <li>If the reviewer has recommended any refinements, the editorial staff would suggest
                                              the author either to implement the corrections or to dispute them reasonably.
                                               Authors are kindly required to limit their revision to 3 months
                                              and resubmit the adapted manuscript within this period for final evaluation.</li>
                                         <li>We politely request that the editor be notified verbally or in writing should the author decide to refuse
                                              from publishing the manuscript. In case the author fails to do so within 3 months since receiving a copy of the initial review,
                                              the editorial board takes the manuscript off the register and notifies the author accordingly.</li>
                                         <li>If the author and reviewers meet insoluble contradictions regarding revision of the manuscript,
                                              the editor-in-chief resolves the conflict by his own authority.</li>
                                         <li>The editorial board reaches a final decision to reject a manuscript on the hearing according to reviewers’
                                              recommendations, and duly notifies the authors of their decision via e-mail.
                                              The board does not accept previously rejected manuscripts for re-evaluation.</li>
                                         <li>Upon the decision to accept the manuscript for publishing,
                                              the editorial staff notifies the authors of the scheduled date of publication.</li>
                                         <li>Kindly note that a positive review does not guarantee acceptance, as the final decision in all
                                              cases lies with the editorial board.
                                              By his authority, the editor-in-chief rules the final solution of every conflict.</li>
                                         <li>Original reviews of submitted manuscripts remain deposited permanently (not less than 5 years).</li>
                                         <li>Manuscript reviews are not published. Reviews can be sent to the Ministry of Education and Science of

                                <p>Editors have sole responsibility for acceptance or rejection of a manuscript.
                                     The manuscript may be rejected by the editor on the stage prior to peer-review
                                      for a solid reason (inappropriate topic for journal, clearly of poor scientific quality,
                                       the article was previously published elsewhere, essential contradiction to ethical principles of the
                                        Journal was detected). Editors should only accept a paper when reasonably certain. Editors should guarantee
                                         that the quality of the papers conforms to internationally accepted scientific and publication ethical
                                          guidelines. If there is conflict of interest of the
                                     editor with the author of the article, the article should be transmitted to another editor.</p>
                                     <p>The editor transmits all the submitted manuscripts, which were not rejected according to the
                                          reasons stated below, for peer-review.
                                          The editor chooses the reviewers out of the most competent specialists on the topic of the article.</p>
                                    <p>Editors should preserve anonymity of reviewers and should not tell the reviewers the names of the authors.</p>
                                    <p> Editors should guarantee the quality of the papers and the integrity of the academic record and be willing
                                          to publish corrections,
                                          clarifications, retractions and apologies when needed.</p>

                                    <p>Authors of reports of original research should present an accurate account of
                                            the work performed as well as an objective discussion of its significance.
                                            Underlying data should be represented accurately in the paper. A paper should contain
                                            sufficient detail and references to permit others to replicate the work. Fraudulent or 
                                            knowingly inaccurate statements constitute
                                            unethical behavior and are unacceptable.</p>
                                    <p>Review and professional publication articles should also be accurate and objective,
                                                 and editorial opinion works should be clearly identified as such.</p>
